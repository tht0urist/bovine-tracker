/// Base protocol of anything you want to persist in a box.
///
/// ## Persisted Properties
///
/// All stored properties of a type that conforms to `Entity` will be persisted, if possible.
/// For numbers, ObjectBox recognizes `Bool`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Int` (plus their unsigned variants),
/// `Float`, and `Double`.
/// It also recognizes `String`, `Date` and `Data` (the latter of which may also be written as `[UInt8]`).
///
/// ## Relations
///
/// To create relations between entities, use `ToOne` and `ToMany` to wrap the target type,
/// like `customer: ToOne<Customer>`.
///
/// Informal requirements: It is assumed that classes implementing this have an init() method
/// and all properties to be serialized are mutable. For struct types, it is assumed that an
/// init method exists that accepts all properties to be serialized.

/// :nodoc:
///
/// - Note: Used in Alpha 1 only to implement backlinks. When you operate on the level of
///   "a type that conforms to Entity", that's not specific enough; you need to erase the type. This
///   provides specification to get to the concrete EntityId<T>. Will be replaced in future versions.
public protocol __EntityRelatable {
    // swiftlint:disable identifier_name
    /// - Note: Used in Alpha 1 only to implement backlinks and get to the _concrete_ type.
    ///
    /// For example:
    ///
    ///    class Person: Entity {
    ///        typealias EntityType = Person
    ///        // ...
    ///    }
